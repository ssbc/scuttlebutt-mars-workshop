## Session 2018-02-09


Went well
- people having fun gifs / images to play with
- deciding who's going to mars initially
  - voting on who to send to mars
- tech worked perfectly
- prep / coordinationg + comms in the session were all really good
- question queue
- showing people chess / ticktack


Didn't go well 
- being grumpy with eoin felt stink
- we were a bit flat energy
- 'friends' was confusing (it's a fb concept)
- people using false identities to start with felt a bit lorem ipsum
  - suggest people use real identities to start with
- patchwork interface looks really empty to start with
- we didn't role play too much
- scuttleverse reveal was a bit meh


Surprises
- techies didn't ask that many questions about tech
- non-techies seemed to intuit a lot



Learnings
- we expect minimum numbers to run the workshop (>= 6)
- intro the diary + gossip first
- prep rad patterns people might not notice
  - interoperability
  - disaster resilience
- we should strongly show people git-ssb (esp for devs)

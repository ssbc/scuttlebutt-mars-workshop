## Runsheet

- Preflight checklist
  - 2 phones, both with hotspots on, no security. 3G off. 
    - Tape the SSID and password to the phone. One 'EARTH' one 'MARS'
  - Set up 2 new friended identities
    - `mv ~/.ssb ~/.ssb_mars_backup`
    - do test startup, 
      - add your names + avatars (Mission Control, Mars Commander 1)
      - mutual follow
  - usb disks with all installers
  - everyone has internet turned off.
  - projector checked working
  
- set up for participants
  - check no existing ssb users
    - if yes, do backup of .ssb folder or sit out.
    - sort into groups, connect to correct hotspot.
    - ask people not to connect to the internet during the workshop.
    
        
- Role play
  1. establish Earth / Mars bases
  2. do some internal dialogue
    - follow each other
    - messages
    - images
    - demonstrate subjectivity somehow?
  3. have a person come from Mars to Earth (and return)
  4. stimulate divergence: 
    - come up with Mars nicknames
    - instate President of the Earth / change mission control
    - stage a revolt (be coercive from Earth)
 
 - Notice / diff
   - where's the DB
   - how the identity
   - public / private keys
   - content addressable storage
   - no API
   - resilient to disasters (politics, envionmental)
   - cli dump of your feed on projector
   - roll your own interface / messages
   - 

- Internet for Mars
  - stay in touch with Earth (high latency)
  - must work with low infrastructure
- Role play
  - Terrans
  - Martians


- Hey we've built a prototype for the Mars colony.
- Role play
    - What are the locations?
        - Earth, Mars, Ship?
        - Colony, Outpost, Earth?
